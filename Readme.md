# C codes

This repository contains C/C++ codes for various programs.

My goal is to develop a good programming practice with these languages by solving tasks that have applications in AI/ML. 
I am developing proficiency in CUDA/OpenCL programming so this experience will help.

The first commit contains a simple program that implements 1D and 2D Convolution (valid) and test them.
